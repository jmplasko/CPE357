Compile: use 'gcc -Wall -g -o uniq uniq.c' in the command line

Run Program: type './uniq' and then proceed to type what ever you want into
the command line

Explanation: The program itself compiles and runs, but it doesn't succefully 
do what that lab wants it to do. I couldn't manage to get the adjacent line 
to be saved in memory. I think it might be because i just dont fully understand
realloc. After watching many videos and reading man, I figured that when I
used it on the the previous malloc it should keep the pointer pointing at the
old data and either copy it over to new memory while adding the new data and 
memory, or keep the same address and just add the new data and memory. Unable
to overcome that hurdle, I found another way that I could do it using fgetc,
but unfortunately I ran out of time and resorted back to my first attempt.
